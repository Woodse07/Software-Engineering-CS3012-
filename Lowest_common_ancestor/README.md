## First Assignment
** LCA Binary Tree Function **
* Parameters: (root, node_a, node_b)
  * Where:
           Root: is the root of the binary tree that contains node_a and node_b.
           node_a: is a node of the binary tree.
           node_b: is a node of the binary tree.

* Description: This function will return the lowest common ancestor of node_a and node_b in the binary tree given.


** LCA Directed Acyclic Graph Function **
* Parameters: (graph, a, b)
  * Where:
          Graph: is a NetworkX Directed Graph object.
          A: is a node in the Graph.
          B: is a node in the Graph.

* Description: This function will return the lowest common ancestor of A and B in the directed acyclic graph given.

** binary_tree.py **
* Just a class for creating the binary tree.

** test.py **
* A series of unit tests for the LCA functions, made with the unittest library.
* To run these tests: 'python test.py'
